    inspiration of passed creation of Timer in class

    prints the elapsed time to fully execute a given function (or run)

    def __exit__ allows for the with() block to end and for the time to terminate

    exec_type, exec_val, exec_tb are required for the context manager

    python will throw a protocol error if not included - thus needed for compare.py
    
    see instance of with Timer() in compare.py
